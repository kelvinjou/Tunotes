In this app, users could feed in a raw MIDI file type and would output results in Music Notation. Currently, it could only render note length, note pitch and adjust dynamically to the desired transposition. This could potentially be used by orchestral musicians as repertoire master scores could be stored in a MIDI format. Musicians could render specific parts of the MIDI(specific parts of the full score); for example, extracting the Violin 1 part or the Piano part. However, this would probably work best for duets. 

I found myself faced with a paywall when trying to view the full score of a contemporary music piece, as opposed to MIDIs as a lot of them are open-source.
